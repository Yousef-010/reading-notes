> Stages of interview

> Introductions 
- The introduction is where both the candidate and the company will be making their first impression
- It’s a simple strategy, but it’s often all you need to do. When it comes to making a great first impression, 
  - present the company in a positive light.It’s a simple strategy, but it’s often all you need to do. 
  - When it comes to making a great first impression, present the company in a positive light.


> Small Talk 
- After introductions are finished, it is a good idea conduct a bit of small talk with the candidate
- Small talk is important because it’s one of the best methods to foster a healthy working relationship and build rapport
- When it comes to picking topics for this stage of the interview process,
  - try to find something that the candidate is interested in


> Information Gathering 
- After small talk comes a bit of information gathering, or, in other words, asking the candidate to give you their elevator pitch
- This is an important step because it showcases just how prepared or unprepared the candidate is and tests their ability to think on their feet.
- These are all important items to keep track of, as they will often provide you with all you need to know about what kind of employee this candidate will be.

> Question/Answers 
- An interview is essentially a two-way exchange of ideas
- and the candidate will be interviewing your company just as much as you will be interviewing them
- Come up with some standardized questions that all of the interviewers ask the candidate


> Wrapping Up 
- Closing out an interview is just as important as the other stages
- At the very least, always end the interview with a handshake and thank the candidate for their time


> Interview Recommendations 

> Communicate
- The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate, communicate, communicate

> Restate the Question 
- restate the problem to you to make sure I understand what you’re looking for
- The interview should give you affirmation or, perhaps, your understanding is incorrect and they will help you understand.
- There is no situation in which restating the problem will hurt you it shows you can articulate a problem and gives you time to think it through a bit while you discuss

> Ask About Edge Cases
- Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem
- Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem

> Ask About Test Cases 
- This is free and you should take advantage of it. 
- Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.
- Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary


> Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense 
- You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic
- let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later
- **Super bonus: If your pseudocode looks good but you end up having difficulty translating it to actual code**


> If Stuck? Ask for Help! 
- If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally


> 7 tips to ace a programming interview**
- Take a few minutes.
- Write down the steps of the solution.
- Write down the steps of the solution.
- Don’t sweat the small stuff
- Sit down. Be humble.
- Come prepared.
- Review your work


> Notes 
- Algorithmic efficiency 
  - Take some time and consider other approaches.
  - you can bet your pants there’s a solution involving 
  - O(log(n)) lookup time (even if there s additional cost, the total complexity will still contain the log(n)
- Correctness
  - Sure, you’ve solved for the simple, easy use case, but have you checked for edge cases?
  - Off-by-one errors?
  - Issues with negative numbers or empty arrays or missing keys or strings with weird patterns of characters?
  - Maybe you won’t find all of them, but failing to at least LOOK for edge cases before declaring your solution to be correct is a pretty hefty mistake in an interview.
