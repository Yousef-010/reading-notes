> Relational DataBase

- A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Tables are used to hold information about the objects to be represented in the database.

- The rows in the table represent a collection of related values of one object 

-  Each row in a table could be marked with a unique identifier called a primary key

- rows among multiple tables can be made related using foreign keys
