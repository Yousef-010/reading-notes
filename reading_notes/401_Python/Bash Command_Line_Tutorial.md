## Bash Command Line Tutorials

> The Command Line
- it is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

- from another resorce : Command Prompt is a command line interpreter application available in most Windows operating systems. It's used to execute entered commands. 


- Openning  
  - If you're on a Mac then you'll find the program Terminal under Applications -> Utilities. An easy way to get to it is the key combination 'command + space' which will bring up Spotlight, then start typing Terminal and it will soon show up.
  - If on Linux then you will probably find it in Applications -> System or Applications -> Utilities. Alternatively you may be able to 'right-click' on the desktop and there may be an option 'Open in terminal'.
  - If you are on Windows and intend to remotely log into another machine then you will need an SSH client. A rather good one is Putty (free) 

- **My opnion :**
 - it is so important to deal with it because is simplify your task on your OS and the pro use it a lot :)

> Basic Navigation 
- the basics of moving around the system Many tasks rely on being able to get to, or reference the correct location in the system.
- A directory is a file the solo job of which is to store the file names and the related information. All the files, whether ordinary, special, or directory, are contained in directories.
- Unix uses a hierarchical structure for organizing files and directories. This structure is often referred to as a directory tree. The tree has a single root node, the slash character (/), and all other directories are contained below it.

- how to get around it 
  - In order to move around in the system we use a command called **cd** which stands for change directory  **cd [location]**
  - pwd
    Print Working Directory - ie. Where are we currently.
  - ls
    List the contents of a directory.
  - cd
    Change Directories - ie. move to another directory.

- **My opnion :**

  - it likes easy to use you just type tow up to five chars to do a lot of things so it is perfect for the speed of proccesing 


> More About Files

- file.exe - an executable file, or program.
- file.txt - a plain text file.
- file.png, file.gif, file.jpg - an image.
- **__Linux is Case Sensitive__**

- characteristics of files and directories
- A file always has a name.
- A file always takes up storage space.
- A file is always saved in a certain format: a body of text is saved in one of the many text file formats, a photo in one of the many image file formats, etc.
- A file contains information on when it was created and when it was last modified.
- Files usually have access rights, especially if they are online.
- Files are saved on the userâ€™s own computer or in a remote location.

- **My opnion :**
- there is a lot of intersting characteristics in actual this is not for just intersting, it is to check your work and save it correctly 


> Manual Pages 
- The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system including what they do, the specifics of how you run them and what command line arguments they accept

- man <command>
Look up the manual page for a particular command.
man -k <search term>
- Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.
<term>
- Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'
- n  After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item.
